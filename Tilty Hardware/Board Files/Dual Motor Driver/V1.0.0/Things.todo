Voltage divider for voltage sensing and/or voltage reference for current sensing (to increase sensitivity)
All pin numbers labeled on board bottom
Tilty connected pins labeled on top
Change reset pin to one not used anywhere else (eg. pin 2 on the Teensy)
Add transistor level shifting to I2C so it can be attached to 3v3 bus
