!!!!BEWARE!!!!
These files are experimental! Back up any files you might replace before overwriting.  
They implement the serialEvent interrupt routines that standard Atmega Arduinos use, but are not guaranteed to work.  
Also, none of the other software in this repository will use these files until they are included standard in TeensyDuino.
