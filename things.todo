Arduino code:
=============
	Implement smart sensor indicator loading in Processing
	Self-test program for testing IMU, magnetometer, and altimeter

Processing program:
===================
	Add compass and altitude indicators to Processing
		Altimeter gauge
		compass heading indicator
	Implement smart sensor indicator loading in Processing

Documentation:
==============
	Develop EEPROM memory structure (partially done)
	Look into using Doxygen/GitHub wiki

Software Library work:
======================
	HMC5883L I2Cdev testing
	I2C EEPROM library (maybe one exists, should be adaptable to work with large and small EEPROM sizes)

Hardware Work
=============
	Dual motor driver add-on board
	Change header footprints to use locking pattern

Tyler:
Doxygen
Learn to use the IMU (Free IMU library)
HMC58X3 library needs to be updated to work with 32-bit microcontrollers, force 16-bit integers
Flash Library
Kalman Filter Code
